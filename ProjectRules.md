## Group Discussion ##
Available at http://groups.google.com/group/kiddiecaredevelopment

The group discussion board is provided for discussion regarding the project. The following rules apply:

  * Please take note of any stickies and announcements (located above regular topics) as they often contain frequently asked questions and additional thread-specific guidelines.
  * Posts are to be made in the relevant thread. Users are asked to read the thread descriptions before posting. Users consistently posting to the wrong thread may be given a warning (see policing below).
    * If there is no relevant thread, one may be created.
  * Members should post in a way that is respectful of other users. Flaming or abusing users in any way will not be tolerated and will lead to a warning.
  * Members are asked to not act as “back seat moderators”. If members note an issue which contravenes something in this policy document they are welcome to bring it to the attention of a member of the Management Team. Please use the “post report” feature to report posts. Do not respond to such topics yourself. Members who constantly “act” as moderators may be warned.
  * Posting pornographic or generally offensive text, images, links, etc. will not be tolerated and will lead to a warning.
  * Members are asked to respect the copyright of other users, sites, media, etc. Users linking to or asking for information on warez, crackz, etc. or re-printing material without permission will receive a warning and their post will be removed.
  * Members are asked only to post in English, as this is an English speaking community.
  * Members should respect the bandwidth of other users and sites. The use of inline ([IMG](IMG.md)[/IMG]) image tags pointing to data stored on third party systems for which the user has not received permission to link to may be removed.
  * Members should post in a way which is consistent with "normal writing". That is users should not post excessive numbers of emoticons, large, small or coloured text, etc. Similarly users should not SHOUT or use excessive punctuation (e.g. ! and ?) in topic titles or posts. Users consistently abusing this will be warned.
  * Members should use an appropriate, descriptive subject when posting a new topic. Examples of bad subjects include; "Help me!", "I'm stuck!", "I've got an error!", etc. Examples of good subjects include; "Getting an TABLE FULL error upon login", "Cannot restore a backup", etc.
  * Members are welcome to use the test thread for general "test purposes". These may include checking signatures, testing a link or image, etc. (subject to previous points on decency, warez, etc.).
  * Spam is not tolerated here under any circumstance. This includes offering hosting services (charged and free), installation services, solicitation etc. Recruiting members for your own projects (moderators, designers, professional MOD work, etc.) is not permitted and is also considered spam. Users posting spam will be warned and their post removed. See specific item on spam and 3rd party linking for more information.
  * Members are asked to not disclose to any 3rd party, board, or list any vulnerabilities before first notifying the developers. You should submit all finds to our issue tracker. Time should be allowed for us, at least 3 working days wherever possible, to respond.
  * Management reserve the right to edit, remove or put on moderation queue any post at any time. The determination of what is construed as indecent, vulgar, spam, etc. as noted in these points is up to management and not users.
  * Signatures
    * Signatures must be text only.
    * Text sizes should be between 75% and 100% (small and normal). Text in signatures is subject to the same conditions as posts with respect decency, warez, emoticons, and so forth.
    * Personal Links are not permitted in signatures.
    * Users abusing these rules will be warned.
  * Bumping a topic (replying directly after your own post) is only permitted after six hours have elapsed. Priority is generally assigned to topics in chronological order, so excessive bumping will result in longer wait times.
  * Members may include or post links to 3rd party sites in an effort to render support for the project in response to a support request. Members are not permitted to post links to material unrelated to the project or where linked material is not relevant to a given support request.
  * General linking (within posts) to other sites is generally not permitted. Exceptions may be made where links are being offered in a "support context" for non-project related questions. Acceptable support contexts may include (but are not limited to): problems with non-thread 3rd party software, hardware, and so forth. Unacceptable support contexts include requests for hosting providers, questions and discussion of alternative fora systems, and so forth.
  * Policing
    * the project operates a three strike policy. Users will be warned a maximum of three times for any and all offences in a three month period. If the need arises for a fourth warning a temporary ban will be put in place of between 1 to 7 days.
    * Arguing with team members after having received a warning will lead to an immediate additional warning. Should this exceed three strikes a temporary ban will be put in place as above.
    * Users who feel they have been unfairly warned are welcome to contact the relevant team leader, e.g. if warned by a moderator you should contact the Moderator team leader. If they feel you were treated badly they remove a warning.
    * Any attempt to circumvent a temporary ban or other moderator action will lead to a permanent ban of your account(s). Circumvention includes re-registering or using an already registered account under a non-banned username. Other examples include changing IP addresses, using a new email account or other action that can be taken to evade moderator action to hide your identity as the owner of the sanctioned account.
    * An exception to the three strike rule applies when users contact team members personally (via any method) and post insulting, indecent or vulgar material. Such users may be subject to an immediate permanent ban.
    * Permanent bans are a last resort and thought is given before implementing them. While the project may consider lifting permanent bans from time to time this is a rare occurrence.

## Developer Guidelines ##
In order to provide a stable and unified development environment, the following guidelines should be followed:

  * All code should be properly documented inline, following this template:
```
//USERNAME - MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM
//REASON FOR CODE...
```
    * As code is approved these comments will be simplified.
  * Issue Tracker should be utilized to document any additions of code, and mark for testing.
