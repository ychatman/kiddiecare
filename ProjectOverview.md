# Project Overview #
## Description ##
A web based childcare management software that has the ability to run multiple centers with a single installation. Modular format for all, but all inclusive allowing individual centers to adjust needed modules.

Upon further investigation the best method would probably be to run separate installs in sub-domains for each center, as well as separate databases. This is both for data security as well as easier access control to data.
